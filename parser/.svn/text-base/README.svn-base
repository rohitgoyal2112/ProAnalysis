*** TheLang.c
Syntax of the project language as ANTLR input. ANTLR is a tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers, interpreters, compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing actions in a variety of target languages. See http://www.antlr.org/ for more details and APIs.

*** Main.java
Example of a Java main program that shows how to integrate with ANTLR. The program assumes that the parser has been generated from TheLang.g with ANTLR, and that the generated Java implementation of the parser (TheLangLexer.java and ThelangParser.java) is contained in the same package of the main program. Moreover, in order to compile the program the Java ANTLR library must be referenced. ANTLR provides libraries for a number of languages, you are free to choose the one you prefer (or even not to use this tool, but we would discourage you to do so).

*** sample.lang
A simple program in the project language.
